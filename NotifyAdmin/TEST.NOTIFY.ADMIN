      MSG = "Event from ":@USER:" on line ":@PIB
    END
* OPTIONS might include a code to direct message to proper handler
* For example:
*   R1 might be "role 1" admins meaning just sys admins, not developers
*   L2 might be the "level 2 log" which might be an email rather than a SMS message
    OPTIONS = "" ;
    CALL NOTIFY.ADMIN.D3(MSG,"",OPTIONS)
* Last parameter may return a message for the user or app log
    IF OPTIONS # "" THEN CRT MSG
